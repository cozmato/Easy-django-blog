    Retrieves the remote IP address from the request data.  If the user is

    we need to account for that.  In such a case, only the first IP in the
    list will be retrieved.  Also, some hosts that use a proxy will put the
    REMOTE_ADDR into HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR.  This will handle pulling back the
    IP from the proper place.
